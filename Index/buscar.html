        "Why I love them so much?" I always asked myself about this. Whenever I watch them, support them, my love for them increases to the peak that my heart can't handle it. They are luring me in to them.
        I asked again, "Why I love them so much?" And now my heart know why.
        Because of the love that they showers us, armys, the never ending laughter they got us, the meaningful lyrics they send to us in their songs, the time they spend with us even with busy schedule. And most of all, the friendship they have with each other. The strongly bond of them left me in awe. :cry:
    My friend asked me, "What if bts ends up like bb? They end being legends, they wont perform much, they wont release songs that much anymore, they'll start not to post anything."
        I don't want that to happen :sob: without them my life is so empty. I think I'm gonna miss them once they start to get too famous.
        Okay, stop cutting the onions now! Let's just appreciate the dork bts now, shall we? :grinning:</p>
